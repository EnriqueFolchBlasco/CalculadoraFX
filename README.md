# CalculadoraFX  
**Date**: April 2024  
**Project**: 1 DAM Task  
**Description**: A project involving creating a calculator, enhanced with a Barbie theme to make it unique.

> [!WARNING]  
> **Status**: This app contains bugs and is not a fully completed version. It might be finished someday.  

## Disclaimer  
This is my first app in Java since I started learning it. It's not perfect.

### Features  
This calculator includes the following features:  
- **Multilingual Support**: Options for different languages.  
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages when dividing by zero.  
- **History of Operations**: Saves operations with timestamps (may not function correctly).  
- **About & Help Pop-Ups**: Includes informative tabs.

> [!NOTE]  
> This app also supports **KeyListeners**, allowing you to use either the keyboard or the mouse to interact with buttons.

#### Basic Interface  
The basic interface of the calculator. All buttons work initially, but certain combinations may cause issues.

#### History Tab  
The history tab saves operations along with their timestamps.  
> **Note**: The history clears after the app is closed. This is fixable, but since this was my first app, my knowledge at the time was limited.

#### Easter Egg
