# CalculadoraFX
April, 2024, 1 DAM, task about doing a calculator which I've added a Barbie theme. In case you ask why barbie, why not? lol, long live the memes.

<h2>Disclaimer: This is my first app in java since I started learning it. it's not perfect</h2>

This calculator has features such as different language options, error messages if you try to divide with 0, a history of operations (might not function correctly), an about and a help pop ups.

> [!NOTE]  
> This app also uses keylisteners in order to use the keyboard or the mouse with the buttons.

<h4>The basic interface of the calculator, all buttons work at first, combinations may break it tho.</h4>

<h4>Help part has some info of what each key do, also I have  made it so it shows like an admin panel how more or less the calculations work in "live". Plus the hour just for fun and try new things</h4>

<h4>Also an about tab part, that is just some texts, in the second one random jokes about programming appear.</h4>

<h4>A history tab that saves operations with the time they are made. (clears after closing the app, kinda fixeable but this was my first app and my knowledge was not that big)</h4>

<h4>As a bonus, theres a teenegaer easter egg (teenager because won't understand it if you aren't a kid born around 2000-2010 and were related to youtube), when you introduce 777 a pop up image will appear in the help tab with transparency gpoing from 0 to 1 non-stop.</h4>
